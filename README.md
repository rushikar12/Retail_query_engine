# AI-Powered Retail Query Engine: From Natural Language to SQL 

## 🌟 Project Vision  
Imagine a world where anyon regardless of technical expertis can seamlessly extract valuable insights from complex retail datasets. The **AI-Powered Retail Query Engine** makes this vision a reality. By blending the precision of **SQL** with the simplicity of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, this project redefines how professionals access and interpret data, empowering retail leaders to make informed decisions faster than ever before.  


## Key Features  
### 🔹 **Natural Language to SQL**  
No SQL? No problem. Simply ask your question in plain English, and the system transforms it into an accurate SQL query to fetch your data.  

### 🔹 **Powered by Advanced AI**  
Utilizes **LLaMA 3.2 8B**, a cutting-edge language model, integrated with the versatile **LangChain** framework, ensuring robust query generation, interpretation, and execution.  

### 🔹 **Dynamic Retrieval with RAG**  
Implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, dynamically fetching semantically similar examples to guide the AI in crafting precise SQL queries—even for complex datasets.  

### 🔹 **User-Friendly Interface**  
Built with **Streamlit**, the interactive chat-like interface provides a seamless experience for retail professionals, enabling intuitive data querying and actionable insights.  

### 🔹 **Real-Time Insights**  
Execute queries and receive insights instantly, helping you stay ahead in the fast-paced retail landscape.
